# Zola with Yoga!

*Zola with Yoga* is an online yoga studio where you can relax, unwind and reset after a long day of work / school and feel refreshed for the next day. **Zola**, a word that derives from a South African language (Zulu) meaning *'calm'* or *'peacful'*, puts an emphasis on the energy the site will bring to the customers. People are so busy in such a way that they no longer have time to go to fitness studios. This site hopes to help people interested in doing yoga but do not have time to travel to the actual studio. This site also hopes to accomplish a more calm and joyful society without having to pay more for transport. The target market is young and old adults, who wish to live a positive and stressless life. Customers who wish to keep fit but cannot afford to go to a studio.  Customers can also purchase Yoga equipment on the website's online shop.
